# Spotify Challenge

##### 1. What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)? #####
> The purpose of this web application is to help the user discover non-explicit songs by typing in the song title or artist, given that the songs contain non-explicit lyrics. For example, Beyonce's "Drunk in Love" will not show up because it contains explicit lyrics, but other "Drunk in Love" songs not by Beyonce may show up because they contain non-explicit lyrics.

##### What is the URL of this project on your student web-server? #####
> https://students.washington.edu/jessielz/info343/spotify-template

##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who. #####
> Yes - I received help from Stella Ding and Julian Bossiere. Mad props to Julian for staying up late, answering my questions, and troubleshooting with me! I also received some assistance from Mike Freeman.

##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> I would say about 10-12 hours or so.

##### Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> I think that we could have gotten a better explanation about how we could use Angular directives and APIs because when I first got started, I had no idea how to use the Spotify API. I wasn't sure if I had to set it up using Spotify's tutorial or not (thank goodness I asked first, otherwise I would have wasted my valuable time trying to integrate my code with the API according to Spotify's tutorial!).
